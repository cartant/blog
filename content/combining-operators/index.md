In version 5.5, [pipeable operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/6.1.0/doc/pipeable-operators.md) were added to RxJS. And in version 6, their non-pipeable namesakes [were removed](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/6.1.0/MIGRATION.md#operator-pipe-syntax).

Pipeable operators have numerous advantages. The most obvious is that they are easier to write. A less obvious advantage is that they can be composed into reusable combinations.

Let’s have a look at how code can be simplified by combining operators.

## Combining multiple operators

Debouncing user input — to avoid the execution of an operation every time the user presses a key — is a common use case for RxJS. And doing so usually involves the `debounceTime` and `distinctUntilChanged` operators.

If an app performs a lot of debouncing, combining the two into a single operator can be a worthwhile simplification.

Here’s one way the two operators can be combined:

```ts
import { Observable } from "rxjs";
import { debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged } from "rxjs/operators";

const debounceInput = (changes: Observable<string>) =>
  changes.pipe(debounceTime(400), distinctUntilChanged());
```

`debounceInput` is a function that takes and returns an observable, so it can be passed to the `Observable.prototype.pipe` function, like this: `valueChanges.pipe(debounceInput)`.

This combination of the `debounceTime` and `distinctUntilChanged` operators can itself be simplified using RxJS’s general-purpose, static `pipe` function — which can be used like this:

```ts
import { pipe } from "rxjs";
import { debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged } from "rxjs/operators";

const debounceInput = pipe(debounceTime<string>(400), distinctUntilChanged());
```

The returned `debounceInput` function is identical to its namesake function in the first code snippet and can be passed to `Observable.prototype.pipe`.

So, whenever you find yourself using the same combination of operators in many places, you could consider using the static `pipe` function to create a reusable operator combination.

The static `pipe` function also makes something else much simpler: dealing with `pipe`\-like overload signatures. Let’s look at that next.

## Implementing a pipe-like API

The [`Observable.prototype.pipe`](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/6.1.0/src/internal/Observable.ts#L282-L292) and [static `pipe`](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/6.1.0/src/internal/util/pipe.ts#L5-L14) functions have a lot of TypeScript overload signatures. And authoring an API that behaves in a `pipe`-like manner requires a similar number of overload signatures.

The signatures for such an API end up looking something like this:

```ts
import { Observable, OperatorFunction } from "rxjs";

/* ... */

interface Collection {
  traverse(): Observable<Document>;
  traverse<A>(op1: OperatorFunction<Document, A>): Observable<A>;
  traverse<A, B>(
    op1: OperatorFunction<Document, A>,
    op2: OperatorFunction<A, B>
  ): Observable<B>;
  traverse<A, B, C>(
    op1: OperatorFunction<Document, A>,
    op2: OperatorFunction<A, B>,
    op3: OperatorFunction<B, C>
  ): Observable<C>;
  /* ... 5 signatures elided ... */
  traverse<A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I>(
    op1: OperatorFunction<Document, A>,
    op2: OperatorFunction<A, B>,
    op3: OperatorFunction<B, C>,
    op4: OperatorFunction<C, D>,
    op5: OperatorFunction<D, E>,
    op6: OperatorFunction<E, F>,
    op7: OperatorFunction<F, G>,
    op8: OperatorFunction<G, H>,
    op9: OperatorFunction<H, I>
  ): Observable<I>;
}
```

Here, the `traverse` function can be passed numerous operators, which will be connected — as they would be by `Observable.prototype.pipe` — and injected into the observable composed within the function’s implementation. (The reason for injecting the operators — rather than appending them to the returned observable — is so that the operators can control backpressure during the traversal. We’ll look at controlling backpressure with RxJS in a future article.)

There is an alternative API that’s just as flexible and doesn’t involve declaring all of those overload signatures. `traverse` could instead be declared with just two overload signatures, like this:

```ts
import { Observable, OperatorFunction } from "rxjs";

/* ... */

interface Collection {
  traverse(): Observable<Document>;
  traverse<R>(operator: OperatorFunction<Document, R>): Observable<R>;
}
```

With the alternative API, even though the function’s overload signatures allow only a single operator to be passed, callers can use the static `pipe` function to combine any number of operators and can pass the result, like this:

```ts
import { pipe } from "rxjs";
import { ajax } from "rxjs/ajax";
import { concatMap, filter, ignoreElements } from "rxjs/operators";

/* ... */

collection
  .traverse(
    pipe(
      filter(shouldPut),
      concatMap(doc =>
        ajax.put(`${uri}/docs/${doc.id}`, doc.toJSON(), {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        })
      ),
      ignoreElements()
    )
  )
  .subscribe({
    complete: () => console.log("Finished.")
  });
```

Which is great, because having to otherwise declare all of those `pipe`-like overload signatures is beyond tedious.
